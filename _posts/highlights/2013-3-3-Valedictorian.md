I have excelled academically during my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics Engineering, leading to numerous awards at both national and international levels. I was selected as the valedictorian of my graduating class (out of 5,427 students across all fields) in 2013. During the graduation closing ceremony, I was given the privilege to deliver the valedictorian speech.
