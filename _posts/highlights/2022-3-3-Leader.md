To clarify, I am not a "thought leader", a term which I typically associate as a red flag for potentially pretentious individuals (not all though!). I am a leader because I have been fortunate to be put in various leadership positions since my school days.

During my tenure as the Chair of USM IEEE Student Branch, I led the society to an unprecedented win for the Best IEEE Student branch in Malaysia. The shift in direction to enable engineering students from the university to engage with their peers as well as underprivileged secondary schools in different states in Malaysia was cited by the Malaysian IEEE Committee as a standout among all student branches.

*We were notably the underdogs as our student branch has never won the award before.*

Realizing that there was an interest in VR/AR but no official community to participate in, I founded the Cambridge VR/AR society in 2018. I managed to get students, academics, and companies involved as part of the society’s VR/AR community.
