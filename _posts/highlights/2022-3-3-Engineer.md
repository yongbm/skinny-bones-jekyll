I worked as an Engineering Leadership Program (ELP) Engineer at National Instruments. The ELP position is a management training program for engineers that have been identified as potential future leaders of the company. My responsibilities required me to interface with external clients and internal R&D teams to provide solutions. Despite being a junior engineer at the company, I was also given responsibilities to project manage, conduct partial R&D, and product launch of a new robotics hardware product (RoboRIO) that was targeted to promote Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) among students. 

Prior to National Instruments, I worked at GAMUDA Berhad, one of the largest construction companies in Malaysia as a systems engineer. My responsibilities involved project management and interfacing with sub-contractors and external consultants to ensure timely delivery and completion of Malaysiaâ€™s first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) project.
