Ever since trying out the HTC Vive in 2015, I have been fascinated by the incredible potential of VR technologies. Over the years, I have been championing the use VR for various use cases such as training in manufacturing and learning for autistic children.

My enthusiasm for VR technologies have led me to found the first Cambridge VR/AR society in Cambridge. I managed to secure various bits of resources, grant funding, and awards, to work on epxloratory VR projects. Many of such projects have been presented to high-profile individuals and visitors to the University of Cambridge.

I also had the opportunity to try out state-of-the-art VR-related haptics technologies. It is incredibly difficult to describe how amazing some of these yet-to-be released prototypes feel!
