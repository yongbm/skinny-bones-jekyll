Developed a complete RPG game using RPG Maker 95 for my friend, Kelvin Long, as his birthday present. The characters are based on a few of our classmates. I created custom pixel art sprites using MS Paint 98 (great software) because that was all I had access at the time.

Had my 2 weeks of fame as all of my classmates were eagerly in queue to borrow the CD (ancient times) for the software. I had a lot of fun designing the characters, the maps, and also sprinkling the game with easter eggs and hidden treasures. This is arguably my first real taste of game development.
