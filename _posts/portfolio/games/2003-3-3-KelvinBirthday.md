When I was 14, I developed a complete RPG game using RPG Maker 95 for my friend, Kelvin Long, as his birthday present. The characters were based on a few of our classmates and the game was set in our school. I created custom pixel art sprites using MS Paint 98 (great software) because that was all I had access at the time.

For 2 weeks, all of my classmates were eagerly in queue to borrow the CD (ancient times) for the software. I had a lot of fun designing the characters, the maps, and also sprinkling the game with easter eggs and hidden treasures. This is notably my first real taste of game development.
