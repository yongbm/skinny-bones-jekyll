Donjon Fauna is an “asymmetric VR co-op fantasy creature veterinarian simulator” where a VR player cooperates with a non-VR player to heal wounded fantasy creatures. The VR player plays the role of a creature veterinarian intern, tasked with healing wounded creatures which are brought into the creature veterinary. However, the VR player does not have direct access to the manual with instructions required to heal the creatures and will need to rely on help from a non-VR player with a manual. The location of Donjon Fauna veterinarian center is based in a modified underground dungeon.


Donjon Fauna won the People's Choice Award at Develop:Brighton 2023.
