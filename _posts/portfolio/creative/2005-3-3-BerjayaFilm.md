First attempt making a short film for a competition. Made with the help of some friends, notably, Jun Hoong, who also stars in the film. He had to play double duty as co-director when I was preoccupied with some other things. 

The experience taught me that shooting a film is bloody hard. The scene you imagine in your head is hard to shoot than expected due to limitations with resources. The people, the setting, the retakes... not easy. The tone of the short film was also more sombre than we wanted it to be, primarily because we did not have access to appropriate music at the time.

I am still proud of the fact we managed to complete this project. It was tough but we pulled through and finished it.
