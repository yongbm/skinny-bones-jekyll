I was the Art Director for my school magazine. One of the artwork that I was quite proud to have produced as a 17 year old was the "Above the Clouds" class photo whihc I designed with some creative inputs from my father. It was a fun little project and my first foray into the world of Photoshop.

I was also the Art Director of my school magazine when I went to high school. My design won the competition that was organized to pick the cover design for the magazine in 2009.

Over the years, I would say graphic editing skills learnt during this phase has served me incredibly well.
