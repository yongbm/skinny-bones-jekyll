During my time in USM, me and my roommate, Chiou Hwang, decided to build a waterproof robot boat with an Arduino as its controller. Turns out that waterproofing was not so easy. We frantically tried to rescue the boat from completely sinking as we tested it for the first time. In hindsight, we probably should not have tested with full electronics before we made sure boat would not sink!

The boat eventually worked but it was not as responsive as we imagined it would be. This was because we did not have stronger servos to control larger rudders. We also had too small a pond to test out our designs. There was a lake in my campus but given our experience nearly sinking the alpha prototype, the lake did not seem like a good idea.
