I supervised the creation of a virtual Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), my research department in Cambridge. The main idea was to create a virtual IfM that can showcase research by different research groups in an interesting manner.

The software was designed for VR and primarily built by my brother, Yong Bang Yang, who was a visiting student to the department at the time. Blender and Unity were used for the creation of the software.

The software was a huge hit and has been demoed to hundreds of visitors at the IfM.
