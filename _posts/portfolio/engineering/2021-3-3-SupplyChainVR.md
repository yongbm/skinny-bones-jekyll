I collaborated with Dr. Alexandra Brintup on this exploratory project to visualize real-world supply chain network data in VR. The software was developed using Unity which rendered the network data through a JSON file. It works but we found that performance is impacted when attempting to render all the nodes in the network. The other problem is the navigation interface. As it were, you would use the VR controllers to fly around in 3D-space to explore the network. This is fine for a short while but extended usage is definitely uncomfortable as the motion in VR would quickly lead to cyber-sickness.

Still a pretty cool project nonetheless. We managed to demo it to industry figures such as the CEO of Cisco UK.
