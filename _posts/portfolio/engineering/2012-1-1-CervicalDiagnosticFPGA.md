I developed an FPGA-based device to diagnose for cervical cancer with the help of my parter, Yuan Jun, for an engineering competition, Innovate Malaysia 2012. The systems leverages on artificial neural networks (precursor to modern day machine learning) that was developed by our supervisor, Professor Ashidi.

We managed to win a few competitions with this invention. We won the first prize of the Altera-track in Innovate Malaysia. We did not know at the time that the competition was actually menat for 4th year students nationwide. We were 3rd year students who competed and won against 4th year students. 

Eventually, we were sent to London to participate in an international innovation competition and won a few Gold Medals. Good times.
