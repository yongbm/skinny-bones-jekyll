I truly enjoyed the time spent designing and developing electronic engineering projects in university. Among all the topics, I was most interested in embedded systems because it allowed me to create standalone devices. I was a huge proponent of Atmel's AVR microchips (now part of Microchip). Low-cost but incredibly powerful in nature. 

One of the projects that I am most proud of is Guitar Hero LED which I had designed for the embedded systems laboratory course. My lab partner at the time, Lai Chi Qin, is a gifted musician. We programmed the Intel 8085 to generate audio tunes by adjusting the frequency of the audio waves. In addition to that, I also combined this lab project with another analog lab project which required me to design an audio amplifier. It was a good fit. I demonstrated the amplifier works by amplifying the audio tunes generated by the Guitar Hero LED project.
