In my 2nd year at USM, I decided to hack my dorm room door to utilize remote control instead of boring old keys. I gave each one of my 3 roommates a remote control to use. This has been partially documented by my roommate on my Youtube channel (videos below). 

What was not documented was that due to hubris in my designs, I opted not to bring my keys on my first night out after installing the system. An infinite loop caused by a misplaced semi-colon in the code locked me out for the whole night.
