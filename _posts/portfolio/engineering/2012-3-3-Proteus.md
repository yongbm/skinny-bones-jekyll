Broter Proteus, a robot that I built with my partner, Man Yeap, for a robotics competition in Kuching, Sarawak. The robot utilizes Kinect to recognize hand gestures to control the robot.

Participating in this competition was the first time me and my partner booked our own flights. What we definitely did not anticipate was that Proteus was damaged during the flight. We had to turn th hotel room into a makeshift workshop to fix the robot jsut before the competition. We did not have any duct tapes for the repairs at the time, so we substituted it with hot glue (lots and lots of hot glue).

We won 2nd place, pretty good considering 1st place was a Senior Lecturer from UTM (the famous Dr. Yeong Che Fai), and 3rd place was a PhD student.
