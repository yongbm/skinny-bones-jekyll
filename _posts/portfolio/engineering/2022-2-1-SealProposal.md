I built a custom electronic device to be used as part of my proposal to my then-girlfriend, now-wife, Vinye Goh. Since I was in Cambridge at the time, I had limited access to my usual equipment and had to leverage on the community at Cambridge Makespace to build my device on short notice. 

Device was successfully built, and I was on my way with it to Hong Kong for the proposal. Unfortunately, the components in the device had gotten loose during flight take off and I had to spontaneously troubleshoot and fix it while on the plane. All I can say is that I got a lot of funny and nervous looks from passengers and flight attendants as I was tinkering with an unknown electronic device with many wires sticking out of it.

The heart-shaped LEDs will light up when two fingers are pressed and held on to the aluminium pads. Beneath the seal, lies a ring.

*Original designs, obviously the crystal ball dome and speakers did not make the final cut.*
