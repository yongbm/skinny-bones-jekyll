It would be ludicrous if I were to suggest that I organized a cycling campaign in Cambridge. Cycling is second nature in Cambridge but that is not the case for many universities in Malaysia. I was appointed Project Director by my university during my bachelor’s degree to design and execute a cycling campaign to promote environmental sustainability through cycling.

The main target audience were students in the northern states in Malaysia. I was given a budget of RM30,000 (approximately £6,000), which was a considerably significant amount for a student in Malaysia to manage. I had designed the programmes to target students at different levels of education, secondary school students, vocational school students, and university students. I had an excellent team which helped make the campaign a success. We even managed to secure corporate sponsorship from a local bicycle manufacturing company.
