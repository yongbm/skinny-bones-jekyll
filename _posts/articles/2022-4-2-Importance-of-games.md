There are many reasons to play games. A simple Google search reveals many articles on the importance of games, such as to relax, to socialize, to improve yourself, etc., etc... I will not attempt to come up with some grand theory on why games are important (with this article at least). Instead I will just write about some of the memorable games that I have played at different stages of my life and how they have created an impact in my life.

I grew up with computers from an early age thanks to my father. As a kid (between 6-10), most of the games that I remember playing at this age were DOS-based. These games were purchased by my father in the form of 3.5 inch floppy disks. Perhaps it is nostalgia that has distorted my memory, but I think the graphics of most of the DOS games that I played were beautiful, even by today's standards. 

**DOS-based games**
- Lion king
- Skyroads
- Aladdin
- Volfied
- TMNT
- Mortal kombat
- Street fighter

A notable game I played here was Aladdin, a 2D platformer that basically runs you through Disney's Aladdin in about 10 levels. Controls for the game were simple, arrow keys to move, Ctrl to slash with your sword, Alt for throwing apples, and Spacebar for jumping. The only time I managed to complete the game was by playing it together with my cousin. To clarify, Aladdin does not have a co-op mode built in. We actually delegated duties. My cousin would control Aladdin to move and jump while I would press the buttons to slash and throw apples. We managed to complete the whole game including killing the final boss, Jafaar.

Many years later, when I was an older teenager (and once as an adult), I revisted Aladdin. I thought I should be able to breeze through Aladdin as I had accumulated years of experience playing hardcore platformers like Megaman by that time. However, I was surprised to find that I could never get pass level 8, the Genie level, and many times, I fail even before that. It is absolutely bonkers that as kids, me and my cousin actually managed to share controls, co-ordinate, and complete the entire game. Perhaps our success was due to the constant encouragement we were giving each other while playing, or perhaps it was because we could concentrate on doing our jobs well. Whatever it was, the lesson I learnt here is that sometimes you may achieve more when working on something with someone you trust, rather than go at it solo. 

My father gradually upgraded our home computers to Windows 3.11, and later to 95, and 98. I was around 10 when I started using Windows 98. We had dial-up internet access at the time. Somehow, as a 10 year old, I managed to navigate the internet, and by chance, stumble upon emulators and downloaded the Red and Blue Pokemon ROMs to play on the PC. All of this despite not really understanding what are emulators, ROMs, or Pokemon. For context, this was 1999, a full year before Pokemon would arrive in Malaysia.

I fondly remember exploring Veridian forest and battling Pikachu for the first time. Excited, I went to school the next day to tell my friends about it. They entertained me but I am pretty they thought I was babbling nonsense when they heard me talking about a "rat that can shoot lightning". When Pokemon arrived in Malaysia the following year, it was all the craze among my classmates, but by then I had already finished the game multiple times. 

Growing older, I began to understand emulators and ROMs. I understood it as a way to play Gameboy and Super Nintendo (SNES) games for free. At the time, my family could not afford Gameboys and Super Nintendos. So discovering the world of emulators was a literally a game changer. I downloaded all the ROMs I could get my hands on. Initially, Gameboy and Super Nintendo, eventually Playstation 1 games when a reliable emulator was released (VGS emulator). Thus, began the era of emulator games.

**Emulator games**
- Pokemon series
- Final fantasy 4, 6
- Digimon World 2
- WWE Smackdown 2
- Megaman series

There are so many things I can talk about on the emulated games that I played during this time. I will choose to focus on the Japanese RPGs, like the Pokemon series and Digimon World 2. Once I had more experience in understanding emulators, I began to keep track of the ROM release of new Pokemon games. The Japanese version always gets released first, before it gets ROM-hacked (modified by other users) to have partial fan-translation in English, and finally the full English release. It may take months between the release of the Japanese ROMs and the English ROMs. At the time, I would not let something as minor as not understanding Japanese to stop me from enjoying a new Pokemon game. I managed to complete every single new Japanese Pokemon game together with my brothers. We had some help of course, by scouring the internet for FAQs and walkthroughs. A lot of trial and errors and guessing were needed to finish the games but we enjoyed every moment of it. 

A few years later, when Digimon World 2 was released, we did the same thing, completed the Japanese version with the help of walkthroughs and FAQs. However, our confidence did eventually grow a tad too big and we purchased some Japanese games that were not popular enough to have online walkthroughs. Despite a lot of trial and errors, we still could not figure them out. Still, I learnt a great lesson in being resourceful and resilient to achieve an objective. I never considered not playing the games as an option. All I could think of at that time were thoughts like, "How to get past the pesky NPC that is blocking the path! What does he want??".
